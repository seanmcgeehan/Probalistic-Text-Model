# Probalistic-Text-Model

In this project we built a simple language model that can be used to generate random text resembling a source document. This program tokenizes the source texts and processes it to produce frequencies of words following a given n-gram. The model then uses these frequencies to determine the probablility of certain words occuring at a point in a document. With this information the model can generate random text that resembles the source document. 


In this repoitory I've supplied some sample text from Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that can be used to generate random sentences that resemble the writing of Hunter S. Thompson
